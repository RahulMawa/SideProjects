# SideProjects
------------------------------
About this repo: This repo has all that I have done (that I can publically share) as my Side Projects when I am bored, or want to experiment with something new, or when I am actively participating along an Online Course.

------------------------------
This repo is made specially to show my gradual progress in my Programming skills (for various languages/purposes)
the projects that I make on the way. 

This is ideally targetted towards people who are interested to check the progression of my programming skills/career.

------------------------------
Also, I make some videos on Youtube under the channel name: 'Developer Mawa'. 

So, if you're interested in the hackathon projects that I make, 
alongside some sort of casual Arduino / Python / Data Science related projects that I play around with,
then you should check out my content there:
